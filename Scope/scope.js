Blocks and Scope
Scope is the idea in programming that some variables are accessible/inaccessible from other parts of the program.
Blocks are statements that exist within curly braces {}.

/*
Global Scope
Global scope refers to the context within which variables are accessible to every part of the program.
Global namespace is the space in our code that contains globally scoped information.
Global variables are variables that exist within global scope.

/* Block Scope
Block scope refers to the context within which variables that are accessible only within the block they are defined.
Local variables are variables that exist within block scope.
const and let are block scoped variables, meaning they are only accessible in their block or nested blocks.

Scope Pollution
Scope pollution is when too many variables exist in a namespace or variable names are reused.

Practice Good Scoping
Tightly scoping your variables will greatly improve your code in several ways.
 It is best practice to keep global variables to a minimum.
